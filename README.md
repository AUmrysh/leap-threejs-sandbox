Just testing some leap motion and three.js interaction

The rotating box uses the rotation vector of your first pointing finger to detrmine the rotation of the box.
If you can't figure out how the box rotation and your finger rotation are related, imagine your hand is sticking through the box and your finger is pointing where the back face of the box should look.
